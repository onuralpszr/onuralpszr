SAHI is an open-source project that provides a simple and efficient way to perform slicing-based inference for object detection models. Designed to work with various deep learning frameworks and models, making it a versatile tool for computer vision tasks.

As a co-maintainer, I help improve inference quality on high-resolution imagery and maintain the project for the community.
