The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open-source software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform. 

As a dedicated member of the Fedora community, my involvement spans multiple roles:
- Fedora Ambassadors
- Fedora Design Team Member
- Fedora L10n Translation Team Member
- Fedora Packager
- Fedora KDE SIG Member
- Fedora Mindshare Committee Member
