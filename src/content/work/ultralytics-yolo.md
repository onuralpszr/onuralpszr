As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Ultralytics, I work on developing and maintaining the state-of-the-art YOLO framework. This includes training models, optimizing inference, and building tools for real-world computer vision applications.

Key contributions:
- Model training and optimization for YOLO11, YOLO26 and beyond
- ONNX and TensorRT export optimizations
- Edge deployment with ExecuTorch
- API design and documentation
